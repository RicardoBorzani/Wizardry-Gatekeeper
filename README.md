# Wizardry-Gatekeeper
Authentication and security component based on OAuth, OpenID Connect, and Spring Security. The Wizardry Gatekeeper provides a layer of security for your services by managing user authentication and authorization. It supports advanced authentication flows such as Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

## Sprint backlog

### Sprint 12: Authentication and User Management.

#### Description: 
Establish basic authentication and authorization functionality using OAuth and OpenID Connect protocols, allowing users to register, authenticate, and manage their accounts.
#### Objective: 
This sprint will focus on implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication flows, as well as user registration and management, and role-based access control.

- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow (5 points)
- Add support for OpenID Connect (3 points)
- Implement user registration and management (8 points)
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) (5 points)
- Write unit tests for authentication and authorization (2 points)

### Sprint 13: Performance and Multi-Factor Authentication.

#### Description: 
Enhance authentication and authorization capabilities with multi-factor authentication and token revocation.
#### Objective: 
This sprint will focus on improving authentication and authorization performance, implementing multi-factor authentication, and adding support for token revocation and expiration. Integration tests will be written for OAuth, OpenID Connect, and RBAC, and code will be refactored to improve maintainability.

- Improve authentication and authorization performance (5 points)
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) (8 points)
- Add support for token revocation and expiration (3 points)
- Write integration tests for OAuth, OpenID Connect, and RBAC (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)

### Sprint 14: API Security Features and Third-Party Identity Providers.

#### Description: 
Improve API security with rate limiting, support for third-party identity providers, and password policies.
#### Objective: 
This sprint will focus on implementing API rate limiting and throttling, adding support for third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook), and implementing password policies and account lockout. Integration tests will be written for API security features, and code will be refactored to improve maintainability.

- Implement API rate limiting and throttling (5 points)
- Add support for third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook) (8 points)
- Implement password policies and account lockout (5 points)
- Write integration tests for API security features (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)

### Sprint 15: Audit Logging and Encryption.

#### Description: 
Enhance security with audit logging, encryption, and two-factor authentication.
#### Objective: 
This sprint will focus on implementing audit logging and monitoring, adding support for encryption and decryption of sensitive data, and implementing two-factor authentication. Integration tests will be written for audit logging, encryption, and 2FA, and code will be refactored to improve maintainability.

- Implement audit logging and monitoring (5 points)
- Add support for encryption and decryption of sensitive data (8 points)
- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) (5 points)
- Write integration tests for audit logging, encryption, and 2FA (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)
