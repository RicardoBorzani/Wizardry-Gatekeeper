#64: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-4A Implement audit logging and monitoring

1: Define the audit logging requirements for your application, such as which events should be logged and what data should be included in each log entry.
 - Define the types of events that should be audited in your application, such as user logins, data changes, or access attempts.
 - Determine the information that should be included in each audit log entry, such as the user ID, the timestamp, and the action performed.

2: Choose a logging framework or library to use in your application, such as Logback or Log4j.
 - Research and select a logging framework or library that meets your application's requirements and constraints.
 - Install and configure the selected logging framework or library in your application.

3: Configure the logging framework to write audit logs to a designated location, such as a file or a database.
 - Define the storage location and format for the audit logs, such as a file on the server or a database table.
 - Configure the logging framework to write audit logs to the designated location.

4: Implement code to generate audit log entries at appropriate points in your application's workflows, such as when users authenticate or perform sensitive actions.
 - Add code to your application to generate audit log entries for the defined events and actions.
 - Ensure that the logging code is properly integrated into the application's workflows and accurately captures the required information.

5: Ensure that the audit logging code is thread-safe and doesn't impact the performance of the application.
 - Test the logging code to ensure that it does not cause any performance issues or concurrency problems.
 - Use best practices for multi-threaded applications to ensure that the logging code is thread-safe.

6: Implement monitoring for your audit logs, such as setting up alerts or dashboards to track metrics related to the logs.
 - Define the metrics and alerts that you want to track for your audit logs, such as the number of failed login attempts or the frequency of data changes.
 - Set up a monitoring system, such as an alerting system or a dashboard, to track these metrics and provide visibility into the audit logs.

7: Determine how long you need to retain audit logs, and implement a log retention policy that aligns with your organization's policies and regulatory requirements.
 - Determine the retention period for your audit logs, based on your organization's policies and regulatory requirements.
 - Implement a log retention policy that ensures that the audit logs are retained for the required period of time, and are securely deleted when no longer needed.
