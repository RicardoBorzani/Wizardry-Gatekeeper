#65: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-4B Add support for encryption and decryption of sensitive data

1: Define which data needs to be encrypted and decrypted:
 - Determine which data in your application is sensitive and needs to be protected from unauthorized access. This could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive data types.

2: Choose an appropriate encryption algorithm and key management scheme:
 - Research and choose an encryption algorithm that is appropriate for your data protection needs, such as AES or RSA. Determine a key management scheme that will enable secure storage and handling of encryption keys.

3: Implement the encryption and decryption functions for the selected algorithm:
 - Write code to implement the encryption and decryption functions for the chosen encryption algorithm. Ensure that the functions are implemented securely and follow best practices for cryptography.

4: Integrate the encryption and decryption functions into the appropriate parts of the codebase:
 - Update your codebase to use the encryption and decryption functions where necessary to protect sensitive data. This may involve changes to database access, API endpoints, or other parts of your application.

5: Update any relevant documentation and user-facing interfaces to reflect the added security measures:
 - Update any relevant documentation, such as user guides or API documentation, to inform users about the added security measures. Ensure that users are aware of any changes in data handling or access as a result of the added security measures.

6: Write integration tests for the encryption and decryption functionality:
 - Write tests to ensure that the encryption and decryption functions are working as expected and protecting sensitive data appropriately. These tests should cover different data types, key management scenarios, and other relevant use cases.

7: Perform extensive testing to ensure that sensitive data is properly protected and that there are no performance or functionality issues caused by the added security measures:
 - Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the added security measures are functioning as expected and that there are no performance or functionality issues introduced by the encryption and decryption functions. This may involve load testing or other stress testing scenarios to ensure that the added security measures do not impact the performance of the application.
