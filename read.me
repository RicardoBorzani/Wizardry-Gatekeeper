#51: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-1C Implement user registration and management

1: Define the user model and database schema, including required fields such as username, password, and email address.
 - Define the attributes for the user model, such as username, password, and email address.
 - Create the database schema for the user model, including any necessary relationships with other models.
 - Ensure that the database schema is well-designed for efficient querying and scaling.

2: Implement the user registration endpoint, which should allow new users to create an account by providing their information.
 - Create an API endpoint that accepts user registration requests.
 - Validate the incoming user information, including checking for any required fields and ensuring that the email address is unique.
 - Store the user information in the database and generate a unique authentication token.

3: Implement the user authentication endpoint, which should verify the user's credentials and return a token for future API calls.
 - Create an API endpoint that accepts user authentication requests.
 - Verify the user's credentials, including checking the password hash against the stored value.
 - Generate a unique authentication token and return it to the user.

4: Implement the user profile endpoint, which should allow users to view and update their own account information.
 - Create an API endpoint that allows users to view and update their own account information.
 - Authenticate the user by verifying the authentication token provided with the request.
 - Ensure that only the user associated with the token can modify their own account information.

5: Implement the user management endpoints, which should allow administrators to view and modify user accounts (e.g. reset passwords, delete accounts).
 - Create API endpoints that allow administrators to view and modify user accounts.
 - Authenticate the administrator using a separate authentication method, such as OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.
 - Ensure that only authorized administrators can access these endpoints.
 - Implement functionality such as resetting passwords, deleting accounts, and modifying user information as necessary.

6: Write unit tests for the user registration, authentication, and management endpoints to ensure they work as expected.
 - Write tests that cover all of the functionality of the user registration, authentication, and management endpoints.
 - Use testing frameworks such as pytest or unittest to automate testing.

7: Update the authentication and authorization logic to support user accounts, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources.
 - Modify the authentication and authorization logic to include user accounts, including checking the authentication token and verifying the user's permissions.
 - Ensure that unauthorized users are prevented from accessing protected resources.

8: Refactor the code as necessary to improve readability and maintainability.
 - Review the code and make any necessary changes to improve readability and maintainability.
 - Use code analysis tools to identify potential issues and address them as needed.
 - Follow best practices for code organization, documentation, and naming conventions.
