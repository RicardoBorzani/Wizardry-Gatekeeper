Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-4D: Write integration tests for audit logging, encryption, and 2FA
This Pull Request implements integration tests for the recently added security features: audit logging, encryption, and two-factor authentication (2FA).

Tasks

1: Set up the test environment
 - Create a separate test database to prevent data corruption
 - Configure test properties in the project to use the test database and other testing-specific configurations

2: Create test cases for audit logging
 - Identify all relevant events that should be logged
 - Write test cases that ensure each event is logged correctly
 - Verify that the logging output contains the expected data

3: Create test cases for encryption and decryption
 - Identify sensitive data that needs to be encrypted and decrypted
 - Choose an encryption algorithm and key management scheme
 - Write test cases that verify that the encryption and decryption functions are working as expected
 - Verify that the decrypted data matches the original data

4: Create test cases for 2FA
 - Choose and implement a 2FA method (e.g., SMS, email, app-based authentication)
 - Modify the authentication flow to include a 2FA verification step
 - Write test cases that verify that the second factor is required and correctly validated for user authentication
 - Write test cases that cover all relevant 2FA recovery options

5: Configure the test framework to use OAuth, OpenID Connect, and RBAC
 - Implement these authentication and authorization protocols in the test environment to ensure that the tests accurately simulate real-world usage scenarios

6: Integrate the tests with the build and deployment process
 - Ensure that the tests are automatically run with each build and deployment to catch any regressions or new issues that may arise

7: Execute the integration tests
 - Verify that all implemented security features are working as expected
 - Identify any issues that were not caught during development or unit testing

8: Fix any issues identified during testing
 - Make the necessary code changes to fix any identified issues
 - Repeat the testing process to verify that the issues have been resolved

9: Document the test cases and results
 - Ensure that the test cases and results are documented for future reference and to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.

Conclusion
 - By implementing these integration tests for the new security features, we ensure that the code is robust, secure, and functioning as expected. Any issues that are found during testing are promptly addressed, improving the overall quality and security of the application.
