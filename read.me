#56: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-2C Add support for token revocation and expiration

This Pull Request introduces support for token revocation and expiration in the system. These features help improve security by allowing you to invalidate or expire access tokens as needed.

Tasks

1: Define token revocation and expiration requirements
 - Define the requirements for token revocation and expiration based on your project needs and security policies. Consider factors such as how long tokens should be valid, under what circumstances they should be revoked, and how to handle token revocation in the event of a security breach.

2: Implement token revocation mechanism
 - Implement a mechanism for token revocation, such as adding a new API endpoint for revoking tokens or updating the data model to track revoked tokens. Ensure that revoked tokens are not accepted as valid credentials in the authentication and authorization flow.

3: Implement token expiration mechanism
 - Implement a mechanism for token expiration, such as adding a new component to the application that periodically checks for and removes expired tokens. Ensure that expired tokens are not accepted as valid credentials in the authentication and authorization flow.

4: Integrate token revocation and expiration mechanisms
 - Integrate the token revocation and expiration mechanisms into the existing authentication and authorization flow, ensuring that revoked or expired tokens are not accepted as valid credentials. Test the functionality thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.

5: Write unit tests
 - Write unit tests for the new functionality to ensure that it is working as expected. Test scenarios such as revoking an active token and verifying that it is no longer accepted, and attempting to use an expired token and verifying that it is rejected.

6: Write integration tests
 - Write integration tests that cover various scenarios, such as revoking an active token and verifying that it is no longer accepted, and attempting to use an expired token and verifying that it is rejected.

7: Document changes
 - Document the new functionality and any changes made to the architecture or data model to support it. This can include updating user guides or developer documentation as needed.

Conclusion
 - Adding token revocation and expiration support improves the security of the system by allowing you to revoke or expire access tokens as needed. By following these steps, you can successfully implement this feature and ensure that it works as expected.
