#59: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-3A Implement API rate limiting and throttling

1: Research and select a rate limiting and throttling solution that fits the project's requirements and constraints.
 - Research different rate limiting and throttling solutions that are available for the programming language and framework used in the project.
 - Evaluate the solutions based on factors such as ease of integration, scalability, flexibility, and cost.
 - Select a solution that best fits the project's requirements and constraints.

2: Integrate the selected solution with the project's existing codebase.
 - Follow the integration instructions provided by the selected solution's documentation.
 - Make any necessary changes to the project's codebase to enable the integration.

3: Define and configure rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint based on the project's requirements and use cases.
 - Determine the appropriate rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint based on the expected traffic patterns and usage scenarios.
 - Configure the selected solution to enforce the rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint.

4: Implement the rate limiting and throttling logic in the project's codebase, using the selected solution's API or libraries.
 - Use the selected solution's API or libraries to implement the rate limiting and throttling logic in the project's codebase.
 - Ensure that the rate limiting and throttling logic is integrated with the existing authentication and authorization flow.

5: Test the rate limiting and throttling functionality using a variety of scenarios and load conditions, to ensure that it works as expected and does not negatively impact the system's performance or user experience.
 - Create test scenarios that simulate different traffic patterns and usage scenarios.
 - Test the rate limiting and throttling functionality under different load conditions, including high traffic and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
 - Ensure that the rate limiting and throttling functionality does not negatively impact the system's performance or user experience.

6: Document the rate limiting and throttling configuration and usage guidelines, for future reference and maintenance.
 - Document the rate limiting and throttling configuration, including the rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint.
 - Provide usage guidelines for developers and system administrators to ensure that the rate limiting and throttling functionality is used effectively and appropriately.

7: Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance, as needed.
 - Refactor the code to ensure that the rate limiting and throttling functionality is integrated with the existing codebase in a readable, maintainable, and performant manner.
 - Ensure that the refactored code passes all tests and does not introduce new issues or regressions.
