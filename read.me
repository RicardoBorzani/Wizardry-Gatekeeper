Pull Request #57: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-2D

Overview
 - This pull request adds integration tests for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to the Wizardry Gatekeeper application. The goal of these tests is to verify that the authentication and authorization flows are working correctly and that the RBAC rules are being enforced.

Tasks

1: Review specifications
 - Review the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications to understand the authentication and authorization flows supported by the Wizardry Gatekeeper.

2: Identify roles and permissions
 - Identify the different roles and permissions required to access the services protected by the Wizardry Gatekeeper, and create test scenarios that cover these cases.

3: Set up test environment
 - Set up a test environment with the necessary infrastructure components (e.g., OAuth 2.0 authorization server, OpenID Connect provider) to simulate authentication and authorization flows.

4: Write test cases
 - Write test cases that cover the different endpoints and scenarios involving OAuth, OpenID Connect, and RBAC.

5: Use integration testing framework
 - Use an integration testing framework such as Spring Test to automate the execution of the test cases and generate test reports.

6: Verify coverage and effectiveness
 - Verify that the integration tests cover all the required functionality and edge cases, and that they provide sufficient coverage to detect any regressions or security vulnerabilities.

7: Iterate and improve
 - Iterate on the test cases and framework as needed, based on feedback from the development team and any issues identified during testing.

8: Document the results
 - Document the integration testing approach and results, including any defects or issues found and resolved during testing.

Conclusion
 - By adding integration tests for OAuth, OpenID Connect, and RBAC, we can ensure that the Wizardry Gatekeeper is secure and working as expected. These tests will help prevent regressions and vulnerabilities from being introduced in future updates to the application.
