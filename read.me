Task: Write unit tests for authentication and authorization

To ensure that the authentication and authorization logic in the Wizardry Gatekeeper component works as expected, we need to create comprehensive unit tests that cover various scenarios. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in this task:

1: Identify key components: First, we need to identify the different components that make up the authentication and authorization logic. For example, this might include the authentication endpoint, authorization middleware, role-based access control logic, etc.

2: Determine expected behavior: For each component, we need to determine the expected behavior in different scenarios. For example, what should happen if a user provides invalid credentials? What should happen if a user tries to access a resource they don't have permission for?

3: Write test cases: Based on the expected behavior, we need to create test cases that cover different scenarios. This might include positive and negative test cases, edge cases, and error handling scenarios.

4: Use a testing framework: To create and run our tests, we'll use a testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG. We'll create test classes and methods for each component we identified earlier.

5: Implement tests: Once we have our test cases and testing framework set up, we can start implementing the tests. We'll run the tests frequently to ensure they continue to pass as we make changes to our code.

6: Verify code coverage: To ensure that our tests cover a significant portion of the codebase, we'll use code coverage tools to verify our coverage. We'll aim for a high percentage of code coverage to minimize the risk of undetected bugs.

7: Debug issues: If any issues arise during testing, we'll use logging and debugging tools to identify and fix the issues.

8: Refactor code: Finally, we'll refactor our code to improve testability. This might involve making components more modular or breaking up monolithic components into smaller, testable pieces.

By completing these steps, we can ensure that the authentication and authorization logic in the Wizardry Gatekeeper component is thoroughly tested and works as expected.
