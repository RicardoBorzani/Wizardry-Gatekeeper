Pull Request #59: Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-3A Implement API rate limiting and throttling

Overview
 - This pull request adds support for API rate limiting and throttling to the Wizardry Gatekeeper project. This will help to prevent excessive usage of the API and ensure that it remains performant and reliable.

Tasks

1: Research and select a rate limiting and throttling solution
 - We will need to research and select a rate limiting and throttling solution that fits the project's requirements and constraints. This will involve evaluating various options based on factors such as performance, ease of integration, and scalability.

2: Integrate the selected solution with the project's existing codebase
 - Once we have selected a rate limiting and throttling solution, we will need to integrate it with the project's existing codebase. This may involve updating existing code or writing new code to implement the solution.

3: Define and configure rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint
 - We will need to define and configure rate limits and throttling rules for each API endpoint based on the project's requirements and use cases. This will involve setting limits on the number of requests that can be made within a certain period of time, and potentially throttling requests that exceed these limits.

4: Implement the rate limiting and throttling logic in the project's codebase
 - Once the rate limits and throttling rules have been defined and configured, we will need to implement the logic for enforcing them in the project's codebase. This may involve writing new code or modifying existing code.

5: Test the rate limiting and throttling functionality
 - We will need to test the rate limiting and throttling functionality using a variety of scenarios and load conditions, to ensure that it works as expected and does not negatively impact the system's performance or user experience.

6: Document the rate limiting and throttling configuration and usage guidelines
 - We will need to document the rate limiting and throttling configuration and usage guidelines, for future reference and maintenance.

7: Refactor the code
 - We will need to refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance, as needed.

Conclusion
 - Implementing API rate limiting and throttling is an important step in improving the performance and reliability of the Wizardry Gatekeeper project. Once this pull request is merged, we should continue to monitor and improve the project's API security features as part of ongoing development efforts.
