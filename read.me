Wizardry-Gatekeeper-patch-1D Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

Task List

1: Define the roles and permissions needed for the system.
 - Identify the resources in the system and determine what actions can be performed on them.
 - Group these actions into roles that make sense for the system.
 - Determine the permissions associated with each role.

3: Implement the RBAC model to map roles to permissions.
 - Implement a database schema to store roles and permissions.
 - Create a mapping between roles and permissions.
 - Define the rules for how roles are assigned to users.

3: Create a user interface to manage roles and permissions.
 - Implement a UI for administrators to manage roles and permissions.
 - Ensure that the UI is intuitive and easy to use.
 - Ensure that only authorized users can access the UI.

4: Add RBAC support to the authentication flow, so users only have access to the resources they are authorized to.
 - Implement the RBAC model in the authentication flow to ensure that users only have access to the resources they are authorized to.
 - Ensure that unauthorized access attempts are properly handled.

5: Test RBAC functionality to ensure that users are only able to perform actions that they are authorized to do.
 - Write unit tests to ensure that RBAC functionality works as expected.
 - Write integration tests to ensure that RBAC functionality is properly integrated with the system.
 - Use tools such as static analysis to ensure that RBAC implementation is correct and secure.

6: Write documentation for RBAC implementation and how to use the user interface to manage roles and permissions.
 - Document the RBAC implementation in the README file, including the roles and permissions used in the system.
 - Provide clear instructions on how to use the UI to manage roles and permissions.

Conclusion
 - Implementing RBAC is an important step towards ensuring that the system is secure and only authorized users have access to sensitive resources. By following these tasks and documenting the implementation, other developers and users can better understand how the RBAC system works and how to manage roles and permissions.
