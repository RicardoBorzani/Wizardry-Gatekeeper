Pull Request #49: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

Description
 - This pull request aims to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for the application. OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization that provides a secure way for users to grant third-party access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

Tasks
 - Research and become familiar with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and its specifications.
 - Identify the required OAuth 2.0 endpoints and scopes for the application's use case.
 - Configure the application as an OAuth 2.0 client with the appropriate credentials (client ID and secret).
 - Implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow, including redirecting users to the authorization server for consent and handling the authorization code or implicit grant response.
 - Implement the OAuth 2.0 token exchange flow, including exchanging the authorization code or access token for an OAuth 2.0 access token.
 - Store the OAuth 2.0 access token securely and associate it with the authenticated user.
 - Implement the OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow to obtain new access tokens when they expire.
 - Write unit tests to validate the implementation and ensure it meets the OAuth 2.0 specifications.
 - Document the OAuth 2.0 implementation and usage instructions for other developers and users.

How to test
 - Start the application and navigate to the login page.
 - Click on the "Sign in with OAuth 2.0" button.
 - You will be redirected to the authorization server for consent. Accept the consent request.
 - The authorization server will redirect you back to the application with an authorization code or access token.
 - The application will exchange the authorization code or access token for an OAuth 2.0 access token.
 - You should now be authenticated and able to access the protected resources of the application.
 - Test the refresh token flow by waiting for the access token to expire and then attempting to access protected resources again. The application should automatically obtain a new access token using the refresh token.

Documentation
 - The OAuth 2.0 implementation and usage instructions can be found in the docs folder.
