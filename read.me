Pull Request #55: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
This pull request aims to add support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to the system. MFA adds an additional layer of security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide a second form of identification, in addition to their username and password.

Tasks

1: Choose one or more MFA methods to support (e.g. SMS, email, authenticator app)
 - Research available MFA methods and choose one or more that are suitable for the system.
 - Consider factors such as ease of use, security, cost, and compatibility with third-party services.

2: Implement the MFA methods by integrating with third-party services or building your own functionality
 - Implement the chosen MFA method(s) by integrating with existing third-party services or building your own functionality.
 - Ensure that the MFA implementation is secure and follows best practices for handling sensitive information.

3: Update the user authentication flow to prompt for MFA after initial authentication
 - Modify the user authentication flow to prompt users for MFA after they have provided their username and password.
 - Ensure that the MFA process is seamless and easy to use for users.

4: Store MFA information securely and update user profile data as needed
 - Store MFA information securely, ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted and properly protected.
 - Update user profile data as needed to indicate which MFA method(s) each user has enabled.

5: Write unit tests to ensure proper functionality and security of MFA implementation
 - Write unit tests to cover all aspects of the MFA implementation, including both happy path and edge cases.
 - Ensure that the tests cover security-related concerns such as proper handling of sensitive information.

6: Write integration tests to test MFA alongside other authentication and authorization features
 - Write integration tests to ensure that MFA works seamlessly with other authentication and authorization features in the system.
 - Update documentation and user guides to explain how to set up and use MFA in the system

7: Update the system documentation and user guides to explain how to set up and use MFA.
 - Provide clear instructions and examples to ensure that users can easily enable and use MFA.

8: Conduct a security review of the MFA implementation to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
 - Conduct a thorough security review of the MFA implementation to ensure that it is secure and follows best practices.
 - Address any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified during the review.

Next steps
 - Once this pull request is merged, the system will have support for multi-factor authentication, providing an additional layer of security for users.
